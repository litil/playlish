## 🤷‍♂️ Where does the idea come from?

I am huge fan of music festivals. I attend at least 2 festivals a year, up to 5, mostly all during summer. I think what I love the most is listening to the entire lineup to discover new songs so that I can boast to my friends to know this faaaaaaamous group (let's be honest :) ).

What I was doing for the past few years was searching for every artists on Spotify I've never heard of, then adding their 3 to 5 most famous songs (_also known as top tracks in Spotify_) to a common playlist. Then, I was able to listened to those curated playlists before each festivals.

I was tired of having to do it for each festivals, so I created a quick React app which creates a playlist with the first 5 top tracks of each artists I looked for.

There's place for tons of improvements but that's still a huge time saver for me 💪

## 📚 How to contribute?

I haven't written any _How to contribute_ guidelines but if you're interested in improving this project, just shout me a message! As I said above, there's room for improvements and I already thought about really cool features:

- automatically create playlists from festival lineup
- more metrics such as number of hours a playlists have been played
- more music providers: Deezer, Tidal ...

## 👨‍💻 Stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). So you'll find all the common scripts that come along with a basic CRA.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` or `yarn install`

Installs all dependencies. You must run this before running anything else.

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject` or `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
